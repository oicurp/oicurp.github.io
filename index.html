        		<h1>Hi there, I'm RH DANNY HUANG.</h1>
				<p>This repository contains Python codes for people who're interested in learning Chemometrics using Python as the tool
                    in stead of commercial statistical softwares.The knowledge behind the Python codes are mainly based on the Chemometrics book by Miller [1].                    
					One might find the codes useful in the following application pharmaceutical manfacturing areas:</p>
					<p>
                    1. Control Charts (I-MR, or Shewhart charts) for process and quality monitoring (In-Process Control, Finished Product Testing, Stability Testing).
					</p>
					<p>
					2. Cusum chart for use in microbiological observations.
					</p><p>
					2. Linear Regression, for analytical method validation or routine testing.
					</p><p>
					3. Partial least squares regression for FT-NIR.
					</p><p>
					4. etc </p>
